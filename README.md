## A Calculator for mathematical expressions

Years ago (in 2006), when I was a student in the bachelor's of computer engineering, I developed this app as a final project of my programming course.
This calculator parses the strings mathematically, while it supports nested paranthesis as well.

It is not a complicated project, but I hope it assists new programmers to understand the concepts of string parsing, and objects.
